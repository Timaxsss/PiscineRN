# SurvivorNext

In the context of TEK3's "Survivor" seminar, the goal was to create an app for a (fictional) client that includes an employee gallery and several customizable widgets..

First, clone this repository and ensure you install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

Next, install the Expo Go app on your phone or use an emulator like Android Studio's with Expo app installed.
Once you've completed this step, execute the following command in your terminal:

`npm run start`

Done ! This should run your app on Expo and you would be able to visualize the app for testing, debugging or even showing a demo.
